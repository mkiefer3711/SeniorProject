					<h4 class="text-center">Project Overview</h4>
					<p>The Veterinary Appointment Tracker and Customer Database Application is created for veterinarian offices to help 
					complete daily tasks in one application. It includes features such as a schedule for viewing daily appointments, 
					an add client page to add new clients to the system, a schedule appoinment page to schedule new appointments, and 
					search functionality to search for clinets in the system. The main purpose for this application is to allow users 
					to complete daily tasks quickly and easily all in one application. It will cut down on frustration and increase 
					customer and staff satisfaction.</p>
					<h4 class="text-center">Problem Solving</h4>
					<p>This application was created to allow veterinarian offices to eliminate the use of manual files and transfer 
					everything to be digital. Staff will no longer need to sort through hundreds of manual files as everything will 
					be stored digitally for their viewing. This will allow tasks to be completed easier and eliminate mistakes that 
					may be made when using manual files.</p>
					<h4 class="text-center">Architecture Overview</h4>
					<p>This application was created in Visual Studio using Windows Forms in the C# language. It contains four different 
					forms that are each used to complete different tasks. The main form contains the schedule where users can view appointments 
					for any date that they choose. The Add Client form allows users to add a new client and their pet to the system, so that their 
					information can be saved and appointments can be scheduled for them. The Schedule Appointment form allows users to schedule new 
					appointments for customers that are already added to the system. Lastly, the search functionality allows users to input the name of 
					any client that is already in the system and their information will be displayed. All of the customer, pet, and appointment information 
					is stored in a SQL database.</p>
					<h4 class="text-center">Important Code Snipets</h4>
					<p>Many SQL queries were used in the code to be able to store and retrieve data in the database. For example, the following snippet of 
					code was used to add the input from the user for the client information into the database:</p>
